By Phil Gagnon, Kai Ding\
Date: Apr 15, 2023

## Description

This project is based on a popular Kaggle competition, to predict 7 forest cover types from cartograpgic variables\
The training set includes 15,120 observations and 54 features/columns. The project will include these main sections\ 
in the Jupyter notebook:\
* EDA to identify feature engineering opportunities
* Introduce baseline models including 
focus on Random Forest and\ Neural Network to drive optimal performance through feature selection/engineering and hyperparameter tuning. \
The project will use a series of baseline models to serve as performance benchmark. The main sections of the Jupyter\
